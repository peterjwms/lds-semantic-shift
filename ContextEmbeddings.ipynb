and that the worth of the privilege is so great that spirits are willing to come to earth and take on bodies no matter what the handicap may be as to the kind of bodies they are to secure; and that among the handicaps, failure of the right to enjoy in mortality the blessings of the priesthood is a handicap which spirits are willing to assume in order that they might come to earth.', 'Under this principle there is no injustice whatsoever involved in this deprivation as to the holding of the priesthood by the Negroes.*', '\\n\\n> *The First Presidency*\\n\\nThe first thing I want to point out is that Wilford Woodruff’s statement here is actually taken [from his notes](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/assets/a5c827b5-938d-4a08-b80e-71570704e323/0/361?lang=eng) on [Brigham Young’s rather infamous speech](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/assets/e6a939a0-3402-4771-814d-4eaf2547e613/0/0) given to the Utah territory legislature in 1852.', 'It wasn’t even his comment to begin with.', '\\n\\nThe second thing I want to highlight is that there are two different ways to read this statement.', 'You could read it the way that critics of the Church always frame it, that the First Presidency was saying that black people weren’t valiant in the pre-existence and their restriction from the Priesthood was a punishment for that.', '\\n\\nTrying to use Brigham Young’s words to make that point is pretty disingenuous, however, [since Young dismissed that idea outright](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V08N01_13.pdf):\\n\\n> *No, they were not, there were no neutral [spirits] in Heaven at the time of the rebellion, all took sides. …', 'All spirits are pure that came from the presence of God.', 'The posterity of Cain are black because he committed murder.', 'He killed Abel and God set a mark upon his posterity.', 'But the spirits are pure that enter their tabernacles.*', '\\n\\nObviously, we don’t believe that black skin is a mark of a spiritual curse today, but it was a common belief in Brigham’s day.', 'The more important point is that he entirely rejected the idea that any of God’s children on Earth had been less than valiant in the pre-existence.', '\\n\\nThis is more than a little ironic, since Orson Pratt, the man many critics uphold as the racially progressive model the Church should have followed instead of Brigham Young, taught, “[Among the two-thirds who remained](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V08N01_13.pdf) [after the Devil was cast out], it is highly probable that there were many who were not valiant in the war [in Heaven], but whose sins were of such a nature that they could be forgiven.”', '\\n\\nThe other way of reading that First Presidency statement relies heavily on some of Brigham’s other thoughts.', 'You see, he believed that when Cain murdered Abel, he deprived Abel of his posterity and “[of extending his heavenly kingdom by multiplying upon the earth](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V08N01_13.pdf).”', 'Brigham believed that those who had been meant to have been from Abel’s lineage had already been assigned to him.', 'So, they would all have to be reassigned to other lineages, be born, and also receive their temple ordinances before any of Cain’s posterity would be able to receive theirs.', 'Those descendants of Cain were aware of that decision in the premortal life, but that “rather than forsake him they were willing to bear his burdens and share the penalty imposed upon him,” and come to Earth even knowing it would mean they would have to wait to receive the Priesthood and temple ordinances.', 'They wanted a body so badly, they were willing to accept whatever trials they had to in order to achieve that goal.', '\\n\\nWhen that form letter talks about how everyone born into mortality had kept their first estate and how the privilege was so great, spirits made that choice regardless of what handicaps they would have to endure, it echoes Brigham’s beliefs that black people wanted the privilege of a body so badly, they were willing to wait for the blessings of the Priesthood in order to have it.', 'This way of reading that letter actually says that they were *so* valiant that they were willing to endure extra hardships on Earth in order to receive all of the blessings available to them in Heaven after they received their bodies. *', 'That* was the choice made in the pre-existence, not the choice to be neutral or less valiant than white members had been.', '\\n\\nI obviously have never met any of the men in the 1949 First Presidency.', 'I don’t know what prejudices they held or how they intended this letter to be read.', 'All I can do is point out that there’s more than one way to look at it.', '\\n\\nThe B.H.

“homosexuality” is an abomination.', 'Some Bibles say that, and some don’t.', 'That’s one of the most disputable passages in history.', 'Scholars, and Rabbis before them, have debated the right way to translate and understand it for thousands of years.', 'There is no one translation that is “the” Bible.', 'There are multiple translations that differ at some parts based on multiple original manuscripts that even themselves differ at some parts.', 'And there are ignorant fundamentalists social conservatives who deny the nuance that exists in reality and go around speaking as if “the” only Bible is the one they personally decided to buy into.', '\\n\\nWith the “abomination” talk I assume you’re referring to a socially conservative translation of Leviticus.', 'For starters, whether a Bible days “a man shall not sleep with another man” is entirely a matter of translation.', 'The actual Hebrew in Leviticus is probably best translated ‘men shall not lie on the beds of women,’ and what exactly that refers to is highly disputable.', 'It has been debated by Rabbis since time immemorial and now scholars too.', 'Some thought it meant this particular sexual act between men (and had nothing to do with female on female sexual acts), others have seen it as a term of art used back then to refer to fertility idol worship rites wherein men would pretend to be women as part of false god worship rites (and in support of that interpretation, in the context every time the passage appears in Leviticus there are warnings against idolatry).', 'There have been many views.', 'Also, the passage proscribes death for all who commit the act in question, and there is no historical evidence of Hebrews ever killing someone for homosexuality.', 'So the common fundy belief that the passage refers to homosexuality in and of itself is likely just the typical bigotry and ignorance common to fundamentalist thinking, no different than the common evangelical and fundy belief 150 years ago that interracial marriage is a sin.', '\\n\\nBasically they just use the rarest and most disputable parts of their Bibles to twist bigotry into Christianity.', 'That’s their traditional way to approach “God.”', 'While social conservatives and some versions of Bible certainly say it is a sin to practice homosexuality, social conservatives over the years and centuries and millennia have said everything from interracial marriage to having sex while pregnant is a sin “because the Bible…” As far as Christ, he hung all his actual commands under love your neighbor as yourself which is like loving God.', 'The only question is do you believe him or do you instead place your faith in fundy and socially conservative traditions and translations?', '\\n\\nI for one think it is just as absurd to think being gay, and even having a loving relationship with someone of your own sex, in and of itself is a sin as to think being left handed and writing with your left hand is a sin.', 'It makes absolutely zero sense under what Jesus hung all commands under… just like all the other rules and ordinances social conservatives have added to God’s commands for generations.', 'As far as I can tell, those who say “the Bible” condemns being gay have simply bought a Bible that added that part via translation into English, and then they go around finger pointing as if their translation is the only way.', 'It is basically just modern pharisaicism.', 'My Bible is a fairly standard translation (RSV) and doesn’t say homosexuality is wrong any more than it says making images of birds is wrong or that cooking chickpeas is wrong.', 'Nothing in my Bible indicates gay people are necessarily sinning in relationship any more than straight people.', 'Both can be unloving, faithless and out of control, and both can be loving, faithful and self controlled.', '\\n\\nSome Bibles do say homosexuality is wrong, and say so very clearly in passages like 1 Corinthians 6:9, because they translate a word or two Paul used in ancient Greek as “homosexuals” or the equivalent in English.', 'The problem with that is even ancient Greek speaking Christians used the same original word there to refer to heterosexuals too as well as homosexuals.', 'So obviously it meant something else to them, making translations that render it “perverts” or “abusers” or the like probably more accurate.', '\\n\\nThis is obviously a disputable issue and so if we don’t want to be like the Pharisee we should apply Romans 14 and mind our own business rather than pointing at all the “others” we can find by twisting bigotry into our highly disputable renderings of what is basically one of the most disputable words in history.', 'All Bibles regardless of translation say Paul (the author of 1 Corinthians) is easy to misunderstand (this is said in 2 Peter 3:16).', 'That’s ultimately why there are such differences between translations.', 'When it comes down to it, if someone’s Bible says homosexuality is a sin then that is entirely due to their own choice of which translation to buy.', '\\n\\nRomans 1 is the closest Christian scripture gets to condemning homosexuality in my Bible, but that could be read to condemn all drawings of birds as easily as to condemn all homosexuality.', 'It is natural to draw birds and homosexuality happens naturally too.', 'The problem in Romans 1 was the context it was happening in, for the unnatural purpose of idolatry rather than natural expression of art (as far as birds) or love within one’s personal sexuality (as far as gay love).', 'As far as Christ, sure he observed heterosexual marriage when he condemned divorce.', 'He didn’t command marriage though, or else it would be a sin even to be single.', 'Similarly he observed cooking fish.', 'That doesn’t make it a sin to cook chickpeas.', 'It doesn’t get much more love your neighbor as yourself than a faithful, loving homosexual relationship.', '\\n\\nIt is no coincidence evangelicals used Pauline passages in their Bibles to say interracial marriage is a sin 150 years ago and social conservatives used Paul to say sex during pregnancy is a sin 1000 years ago.', 'Pharisaical tendencies among people

I can tell, all the pointing folks do at homosexuals in “Christianity” is just people ignoring the principle Christ hung his actual commands under and instead using groupthink to find a bunch of

respective audience and that those minute details do not really matter.', 'To Matthew, it was important to present a Genealogy that connects Jesus with Abraham so that Jesus can be the Messiah - which was very important to Matthew because he was a Jew.', 'But to Luke, who was a gentile talking to gentiles, it was more important that Jesus, like all humans, ultimately is a descendent of Adam.', 'It would make a lot of sense if neither of them knew the Genealogy of Christ - because of all the things to teach them, why would he go for that?', '\\n\\nSo, if we accept that explanation, we accept that Apostles too were human.', \"Yes, they witnessed divinity, but that didn't make them infallible or omniscient.\", \"So let's talk about Paul.\", '\\n\\nSaul was a rather wicked gentile before he got a divine revelation that Jesus truly was God.', 'Thus, he took on a new name and devoted his life to spreading the good news.', 'It seems very unlikely that Paul got complete insight in gods plan if even the people closest to jesus get some things wrong.', 'So let us think about how Paul might have tried to get it right: he studied the Torah and interpreted them through his own prejudices

included in this chapter are also the rules about Sexuality.', 'Aside from ritual laws that no Christian I ever heard of, this chapter also deals with uncleanliness.', 'The idea is: the temple, the

entrance of the tent of meeting.', '12 And the priest shall take one of the male lambs and offer it for a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord.', '13 And he shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary.', 'For the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy.', '14 The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.', '15 Then the priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand 16 and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and sprinkle some oil with his finger seven times before the Lord.', '17 And some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put on the lobe of the right ear of him

this law and institution of marriage, with respect to them; for the leaving of father and mother prefigured Christ's coming forth from the Father, and coming into this world in human nature, and his disregard to his earthly parents, in comparison with his people, and his service for them; the man cleaving to the wife very aptly expresses the strong affection of Christ to his church, and the near communion there is between them; and their being one flesh denotes the union of them; and indeed, the marriage of Adam and Eve was a type of Christ and his church; for in this the first Adam was a figure of him that was to come, as well as in being a federal head to his posterity: Adam was before Eve, so Christ was before his church; God thought it not proper that man should be alone, so neither Christ, but that he should have some fellows and companions with him: the formation of Eve from Adam was typical of the church's production from Christ; she was made of him while he was asleep, which sleep was from the Lord, and it was not an ordinary one; which may resemble the sufferings and death of Christ, which were from the Lord, and were not common; and which are the redemption of his church and people; and which secure their comfort and happiness, and wellbeing: she was taken out of his side, and built up a woman of one of his ribs; both the justification and sanctification of the church are from Christ, from the water and the blood which issued out of his side, when on the cross: the bringing and presentation of Eve to Adam has its mystery; it was God that brought her to him; and she was the same that was made out of him; and to the same Adam was she brought of whose rib she was made, and that not against her will: so it is God that draws souls to Christ, and espouses them to him, even the same that he has chosen in him, and Christ has redeemed by his blood; and to the same are they brought, who was wounded for their transgressions, and bruised for their sins; and they are made willing in the day of his power upon them, to come and give themselves to him.\", \"Adam's consent and acknowledgment of Eve to be his wife, shadow forth Christ's
